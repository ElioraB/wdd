    <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">Hey y'all! I'm a dancer, and a singer, and I love competing both. I write my own music, and also play violin. I live in about 2 hours east or Dallas, Texas, and I absolutely love the hot weather, the people here! I have an adorable pet Border Collie named Daisy.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">I've been a member of the church for 16 years. My favorite scripture is Proverbs 3:5-6.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">I currently dont have a job yet, but I'm trying to go into a degree of law to become either a civil litigation or real estate attorney.</p>
