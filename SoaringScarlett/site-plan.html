        People will come to my site if they would like to know a bit of information about my personal favorite family vacations. Those who view my site will get to see pictures and read stories about things I love. People should come here because it’s better to hear about exciting things from the source :) All anyone needs to know how to do is read, and they will understand. They may also learn the names of my family members, I will have their names listed under the pictures so that nothing is confusing. Each page is designed to feature only things that occurred on that specific trip so that there’s no confusion.

      <h3>Mexico</h3>
      <p>
        Near the end of September 2023, My family and I went on a cruise outside the Gulf of Mexico. The Crusie Made several stops; in Honduras, Costa Maya, and Cozumél. At each stop my family and I got off the boat to explore. In Honduras, we had a driver come to pick us up and we rode through all the back roads of Honduras, looking at the scenery and the lifestyle of the people who lived locally, as we came closer and closer to our destination: a small school that taught the children in Honduras English. Each night when my family and I arrived back at the ship, the cruise ship was themed each night differently. One of the nights was a fancy formal night. My younger sisters and I dressed up in fancy ball gowns, (mine was red) and we took family pictures before going down to the dining. Another day, we made a stop in Costa Maya, where we went to see dolphins. I had the opportunity to help train, ride, and feed a dolphin! I also had way too many Piña Coladas. That night, the theme was 70’s attire, so we donned flower crowns and wore fun colors and patterns. That night there was country dancing in the promenade, (the main shopping area) and Karaoke, which my younger sister and I sang a duet at.

      <h3>Washington</h3>
      <p>
        During the early summer of 2022, All of my thirty cousins, seven aunts and uncles, and grandparents all went up to a small fort on a peninsula located in Washington. At the end of this exciting event, one of my family closest family members joined us for a few last adventures before flying home. The first place was white water rafting. Our old bishop, who we had gone with when we lived back in Washington, still had all his equipment, and so he dragged it out of hiding. Each of the cousins rode the tubes down the white rivers, occasionally pausing to jump off of the massive rocks that were in the river from excessive erosion of the mountainsides. Because it was Washington, the water was a little cold, but we still survived regardless and had so much fun! Another place we went was to a place I’ve gone my entire childhood; The Reptile Zoo. The other family and I share a love of animals, so it was the perfect place. We did a scavenger hunt, held some snakes, petted some turtles, and had a female lunch on the tables right outside the zoo, next to a life-sized statue of a Crocodile. At the edge of the property, several large blackberry bushes were growing wild, so we had a few of those with our lunch too. This vacation was one of my favorites because I loved the time I had with my family in a familiar place.
