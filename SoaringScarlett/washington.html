      <p>
        During the early summer of 2022, All of my thirty cousins, seven aunts
        and uncles, and grandparents all went up to a small fort on a peninsula
        located in Washington. At the end of this exciting event, one of my
        family closest family members joined us for a few last adventures before
        flying home.

          Our old bishop, who we had gone with when we lived back in Washington,
          still had all his equipment, and so he dragged it out of hiding. Each
          of the cousins rode the tubes down the white rivers, occasionally
          pausing to jump off of the massive rocks that were in the river from
          excessive erosion of the mountain sides. Because it was Washington,
          the water was a little cold, but we still survived regardless and had
          so much fun!

          Another place we went was to a place I've gone my entire childhood;
          The Reptile Zoo. The other family and I share a love of animals, so it
          was the perfect place. We did a scavenger hunt, held some snakes,
          petted some turtles, and had a female lunch on the tables right
          outside the zoo, next to a life-sized statue of a Crocodile. At the
          edge of the property, several large blackberry bushes were growing
          wild, so we had a few of those with our lunch too. This vacation was
          one of my favorites because I loved the time I had with my family in a
          familiar place.
