      During the early summer of 2022, All of my thirty cousins, seven aunts and
      uncles, and grandparents all went up to a small fort on a peninsula
      located in Washington. At the end of this exciting event, one of my family
      closest family members joined us for a few last adventures before flying
      home.

        Another place we went was to a place I've gone my entire childhood; The
        Reptile Zoo. The other family and I share a love of animals, so it was
        the perfect place. We did a scavenger hunt, held some snakes, petted
        some turtles, and had a female lunch on the tables right outside the
        zoo, next to a life-sized statue of a Crocodile. At the edge of the
        property, several large blackberry bushes were growing wild, so we had a
        few of those with our lunch too. This vacation was one of my favorites
        because I loved the time I had with my family in a familiar place.
