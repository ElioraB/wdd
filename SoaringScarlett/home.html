        <h2>Why Here?</h2>
        <p>
          Those who view my site will get to see pictures and read stories about
          things I love. People should come here because it's better to hear
          about exciting things from the source. All anyone needs to know how
          to do is read, and they will understand. They may also learn the names
          of my family members, I will have their names listed under the
          pictures so that nothing is confusing. Each page is designed to
          feature only things that occured on that specific trip so that there's
          no confusion.
