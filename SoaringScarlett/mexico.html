      Near the end of September 2023, My family and I went on a cruise outside
      the Gulf of Mexico. The Crusie Made several stops; in Honduras, Costa
      Maya, and Cozum√©l. At each stop my family and I got off the boat to
      explore.

        In Honduras, we had a driver come to pick us up and we rode through all
        the back roads of Honduras, looking at the scenery and the lifestyle of
        the people who lived locally, as we came closer and closer to our
        destination: a small school that taught the children in Honduras
        English. Each night when my family and I arrived back at the ship, the
        cruise ship was themed each night differently. One of the nights was a
        fancy formal night. My younger sisters and I dressed up in fancy ball
        gowns, (mine was red) and we took family pictures before going down to
        the dining.
