    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/5b5b5d-00afb9-ffffff-fed9b7-ee8889"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/5b5b5d-00afb9-ffffff-fed9b7-ee8889</a>

    <h3>Typography</h3>

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Verse 2:

      I tried to work through it all. 
      Tried to make it go away. 
      But all these boxed up feelings are-  
      Here to stay 
      And if I ever wanted-  
      To rewind the time to then, 
      I’d make the same decisions,  
      And do it all again.    </p>
    <p>Chorus:

      So now I’m stuck- 
      Stuck on you. 
      Turns out all the things my mother said were true 
       
      And now I’m lost. 
      Don’t know what to do. 
      I can’t move forward or back,  
      Cuz I’m stuck on you  </p>
